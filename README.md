# codecademy-user-directory-api
Node/Express/PostgreSQL REST API to provide basic functionality of a user directory.  Users can add new users to the directory, modify existing users, delete users, and view users.

## Running the app
To run locally, `npm install`, then `npm run start`.

This project requires a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database to be running locally.  Reference the ERD diagram located in the `resources` folder of this repo to view the structure of the tables.  You can use [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to interact with the database manually. 

This repo includes an `example.env` file that contains important environment variables for reference.  Make sure to create a `.env` file and include all variables found in the `example.env` file, replacing the example values with those specific to your environment/needs.

Once the app is running locally, you can access the API at `http://localhost:<your-port>`

## Testing
Swagger documentation available at `http://localhost:<your-port>/docs`

You can use various HTTP clients such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to make requests to the API endpoints.
